# ImportWord
This repository is an example to import word documentation and convert it into GitHub Flavord Mardown. The output will be zipped and stored as an artifact of the word2gfm action.

To convert your docx file to markdown, put your file in a folder inside the input folder. For e.g. :  
/input/S1PRO/my_file.docx  
/input/S1PRO/my_other_file.docx

Then go to the word2gfm Action page : https://github.com/SANDBOX-COPRS/ImportWord/actions/workflows/word2gfm.yml  
And download the documentation artifact from your run.
